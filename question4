John is reading a mystery book involving cryptography. In one part of the book, the author gives a ciphertext "CIW" and two paragraphs later the author tells the reader that this is a shift cipher and the plaintext is "yes". In the next chapter, the hero found a tablet in a cave with "XVIEWYWI" engraved on it. John immediately found the actual meaning of the ciphertext. Identify the type of attack and plaintex
def shift_cipher_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):
    return ''.join([chr((ord(c) - 65 - shift) % 26 + 65) for c in ciphertext])

ciphertext = "CIW"
plaintext = "yes"
shift = (ord(ciphertext[0]) - ord(plaintext[0])) % 26

ciphertext_tablet = "XVIEWYWI"
decrypted_tablet = shift_cipher_decrypt(ciphertext_tablet, shift)
print(decrypted_tablet.lower())
